# SDVRP-Meta-Heuristic-Approach
Solving the Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem by a Meta-Heuristic Approach, which firstly splits customer demand by PASA and then solves the corresponding VRP using Google OR Tool Solver. I combined these two algorithms in Python to solve SDVRPs. This combination is significantly time-efficient.  
Run these three Python files, saving them in the same folder. The input file should be in distance matrix form.
